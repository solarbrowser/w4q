# Why I'm Building Quanta

The idea of building a JavaScript engine has been with me for a long time. I started programming when I was ten during the COVID-19 lockdown. Having that much free time was the spark for me. I began by writing joke viruses with Visual Basic Script and eventually met someone online who introduced me to C#.

As I was learning C#, I discovered Discord bots and that was my first contact with JavaScript. Around the same time, I became obsessed with web browsers. I downloaded and tried almost every browser available. Naturally, I wanted to build my own. 

At first, I didn't understand the complexity of how a browser actually worked. I used WebView to make a very basic browser with just a URL bar and some navigation buttons. By the summer of 2023, I made a more "complete" version using .NET that actually supported tabs, but it still didn't feel like I had achieved my dream. 

I had to take a break from programming to study for the high school entrance exams in Turkey. It was a tough year and I didn't get into the school I wanted. However, that experience pushed me to work even harder on my own projects when I returned.

In late 2024, after prototyping some ideas in Python and Dart, I realized that focusing on the browser UI was the wrong approach. To build a truly different web experience, I had to go deeper. I needed to build the engine. That is how Quanta started.

### Why "Quanta"?

The name Quanta comes from my original browser project, Solar. In physics, a quantum is the smallest unit of any physical entity. In a browser, JavaScript is that fundamental unit. Without it, the modern web doesn't exist.

The problem I want to solve with Quanta in the future is software efficiency. Right now, the way we use JavaScript is very resource-heavy. If you have Discord, Spotify, and Chrome open at the same time, you are essentially running three different instances of Chromium in the background. This creates a massive memory overhead that shouldn't exist. 

RAM prices are increasing and software seems to be getting less efficient every day. While Electron is a great tool, the "one engine per app" model is a problem I want to tackle.

### My Current Goal

Right now, Quanta is a spec-first project written in C++. My main focus is correctness and following the ECMAScript specification to the letter. I'm currently at 88% compliance for ES5, and I'm validating everything using the official Test262 suite.

I’m not trying to compete with V8 or SpiderMonkey today. This is a learning-first project. I want to understand every part of the engine before I start focusing on performance. But in the next few years, I plan to move from a tree-walking interpreter to a more optimized architecture.

My long-term dream is to turn this into a full browser. It might take ten years, but Quanta is the first step toward a more efficient web.
